Title : Math painter App

Description : An app that gets as input the dimensions(width and
height) of a rectangle canvas. Then the canvas color, either
white or black, then ask the user what shape
he would like to draw rectangle or square?
Then the starting coordinates of the shape(x and y).
Then the width and height of the shape.
Then the amount of red, green, and blue the shape requires.

Then ask back what the user would like to draw.
When the user presses 'quit', a canvas.png file is generated with
the images the user asked inside the rectangle canvas with
the right colors
